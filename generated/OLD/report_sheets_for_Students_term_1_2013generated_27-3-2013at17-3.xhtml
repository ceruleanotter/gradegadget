She is a little behind in her overall English proficiency, especially when it comes to vocabulary knowledge. I would recommend she keep a vocabulary list on her own and study it regularly in order to catch up with the rest of the class. Her essay was very well written and I think she has a lot of potential to excel as an English student.</td>

This term in English we started with a unit on identity, exploring students’ identities through poetry and a class dictionary project. We also studied note-taking in order to prepare students for their senior high school classes. Huguette started off the term very strong as an active participant in class. Her midterm exam was a little below average, but she did very well on the final. I hope she keeps up the good work
